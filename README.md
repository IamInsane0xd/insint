# INSINT

I was bored and thought it would be "fun" if I make an interpreter

# Usage
## Building

Before building for the first time, you need to set up cmake:
`cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -S . -B build`

After that, build simply by typing
`cmake --build build`

## Running

Go into the bin folder and there will be the compiled binary file
